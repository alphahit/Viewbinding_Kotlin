//View Binding is a feature that generates a binding class for each XML layout file. The binding class contains references to all the views with id attributes in the XML.

//How View Binding Works:
//When you enable View Binding in your project, Android generates a binding class for each layout file.
//For example, if your layout file is activity_main.xml, the generated binding class will be ActivityMainBinding.
//Advantages of View Binding:
//Type Safety: You get compile-time safety for accessing views. No more findViewById() calls.
//Less Boilerplate Code: Simplifies the process of accessing views by reducing repetitive code.
//Null Safety: Reduces runtime crashes due to null view references.

//View Binding: A feature that simplifies accessing views and eliminates the need for findViewById().
//Binding Class: Generated for each layout file (e.g., ActivityMainBinding for activity_main.xml).
//How It Works in Code:
//Inflate the binding class.
//Use the binding variable to access views directly (e.g., binding.textView.text).
//Advantages:
//Reduces boilerplate.
//Null and type safety.
//Cleaner code.
